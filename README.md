## Philosophy

Weft exists to replace confusion with clarity.

- **No accounts.** No sign-ups, no passwords, no friction.
- **No backend.** Everything runs in your browser.
- **No tracking cookies.** Your data stays with you.
- **No black boxes.** Every calculation is explainable.

Just tools you can trust.

## What We Build

Weft provides calculators and educational content designed for people who are just getting started with fitness. Our tools:

- Explain *what* the numbers mean
- Show *how* they were calculated
- Present ranges instead of false precision
- Never assume prior knowledge

The first tool is a **TDEE Calculator** that teaches energy balance fundamentals.

## Design Principles

- **Clarity over complexity** — Every number must be explainable
- **Structure over motivation** — Systems, not hype
- **Transparency over magic** — No hidden logic
- **Craft over speed** — Fewer tools, done exceptionally well
